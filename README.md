### Project Overview
---
Python program, which performing interpretation of drawing title block, find drawing name and depends of this will organize the drawings. This project consists of impacting work timeframes. Running code takes up to few minuts and saves about 4 hours of work (review ~400-500 drawings). 

Project Objectives:
- Use this project for the current work
- Complete a project to add to the portfolio
- Use python to communicate findings
- Run an analysis on a set of drawings
- Become more familiar with python and ocr files review
  
### 1. Setting Up The Project
---
We have to download few nessessary drawings files and use it for farther review and data analysis. Download files and save them the separate folder ![dwg](https://github.com/Kate-Pol/Drawings_organizer_OCR-Project/tree/main/dwg) folder. This python program exepting files like: png, tif, jpeg, jpg. 

Installing all the necessary packages from ![requirements file](https://github.com/Kate-Pol/Drawings_organizer_OCR-Project/blob/main/requirements.txt)

```
pip install -r requirements. txt 
```
In the command line, navigate into the your venv folder, and activate Scripts folder. Then novigate into the python file. 

### 2. Setting up your Git Repository
---
Create a new Git repository for this project, and connet it to the project folder on your machine.

If you need more guidance, review the GitHub Desktop article and additional help on this Git cheat sheet.

After work is completed we can create and update README.md file.







Program making drawing recognition, reading title, and moving each drawing in specific folder. Folders / dwg's title can add easy into the code, and more specific review.
